## Sending emails directly from your codebase or using a developer service?

For an API service (like Mailgun) **you need to inline the CSS before sending**. See `email-inlined.html` for an example.

You can use CSS inliner tools like [Responsive CSS Inliner](https://htmlemail.io/inline/) or [Juice](https://github.com/Automattic/juice) to do this automatically.

* Copy all of email.html
* Paste the HTML as the source into the inliner
* Copy the HTML output and use this as the email template you send

## Sending emails using a marketing service like Mailchimp?

Use the template `email.html` as is. They'll put the CSS inline for you when you put together your campaign.

## ThriveHive Notes

Modified from simple to card based layout.

Install Juice:
`npm install juice -g`

Run juice on HTML to inline styles:
`juice email.html email-inlined.html`

Note that images under 8K get inlined by default, so you have to use the `data-inline-ignore` attribute on the `img` tag (or figure out how to pass the right JSON command line args to the web resource processor)
